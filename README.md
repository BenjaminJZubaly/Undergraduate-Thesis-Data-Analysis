# Thesis Data Analysis: The Psychology of Scientific Fraud
This is the data analysis for my thesis project, the psychology of scientific fraud. The repository includes the main analyses in a quarto document (thesis_data_analysis_quarto.qmd) and the original dataset (study_dataset.csv) which should provide everything needed to reproduce the analyses. In addition, there is the thesis_power.R script for post-hoc power analyses, and plots_graphs_tables.R contains the code used to produce all plots and correlation tables in the manuscript.

If you would rather not re-run all the code, don't bother! The .html, .pdf, and .doc "thesis_data_analysis_quarto" files contain the code and output for all analyses with a narrative review between analyses as well. You can also just click [here](https://benjaminjzubaly.github.io/Undergraduate-Thesis-Data-Analysis/) for a web version.

Thanks for visiting!
