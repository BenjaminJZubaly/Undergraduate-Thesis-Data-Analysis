Six Rindera species are reported in Iran. No detailed Rindera genetic diversity was investigated using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) experiments. Six plants from Iran's seven provinces were gathered and studied for our scientific purposes. Seventy plant specimens have been gathered in total. Our objectives were as follows: 1) to determine genetic variability among Rindera species, and 2) is there a correlation between the genetic and geographical distance of the species? 3) Populations and taxon genetic structure we revealed that quantitative morphological features varied significantly across plant species. Rindera species were classified into two groups using the unweighted pair group approach with arithmetic mean and principal component analysis. The unbiased expected heterozygosity (UHe) of Rindera Regia was in the 0.18 range. Rindera lanata has important Shannon information (0.30). The lowest value was 0.22 for Rindera Regia. In R. cyclodonta and Rindera media, the observed number of alleles (Na) varied between 0.33 and 0.49. R. cyclodonta and Rindera bungei had Ne values between 1.034- 1.17, indicating an effective number of alleles. Rindera has a comparatively low gene flow (Nm) (0.45). According to the Mantel test, there was a significant correlation (r = 0.33, p=0.0001) between genetic and geographical distances. We identified a substantial level of genetic variation, which demonstrates that the Rindera species can adapt to altering environments because genetic diversity is associated with species adaptability. The current findings indicated the efficacy of RAPD markers and morphometry approaches for studying genetic variation in Rindera species.",36.59,2384,1.24,8.45,4.956,2.355,0.18,3.95,2.094,1.116,0.47,3.95,2.167,0.984,0.18,3.26,1.989,1.315,0.178,1.19,6.06,3.221,1.47,1.41,5.83,2.957,0.977,1.19,6.06,3.6,1.956,-0.643,12,20,6,14,18,34,6,1,NA,1.97,8.19,6.145,1.303,54,81,1,2384,93.35,40.82,32.68,28.05,17.66,39.22,59.1,44.92,34.52,2.68,1.13,0,1.01,0.04,0,0.08,1.55,10.57,6.5,1.22,11.79,4.91,1.55,5.75,0.13,7.42,5.7,4.87,2.27,1.8,0.38,0.08,10.36,0.21,10.15,3.44,1.64,0.29,1.01,0.17,3.19,0,0.84,0.71,0.13,0.13,0.04,0.08,0,0.04,0,0,3.36,0.96,0.17,0,0.04,0.13,0.25,2.39,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.04,0.13,2.35,0,0.21,1.97,0.04,0.13,0.71,0.17,0.04,0.04,0,0,0.04,0.25,0,0.08,0,0.13,0.04,0.04,0,0,0.04,0.46,1.38,9.61,0.71,1.01,6.38,1.43,0,0.21,1.93,5.03,2.14,0.13,1.05,0.71,0.04,0.34,0,5.62,5.54,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,-0.85688818679316,-2.1657259576352,0.489419218566288,-2.53319492586207,40.9,-1.38212326945568,-0.946602100646577,1.01317513287548,-0.215857374400299,0.154626958625125,-1.25431982145161,6.145

Coseismic surface ruptures were charac- terized by shear faults, extensional cracks, and mole tracks, which mostly occurred along the pre-existing NE-SW-striking HinaguÐFutagawa fault zone in the southwest and central segments, and newly identified faults in the northeast segment. This study shows that (i) the HinaguÐFutagawa fault zone triggered the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake and controlled the spatial distri- bution of coseismic surface ruptures; (ii) the southwest and central segments were dominated by right-lateral strike-slip movement with a maximum in-site measured displacement of up to 2.5 m, accompanied by a minor vertical component. In contrast, the northeast segment was dominated by normal faulting with a maximum vertical offset of up to 1.75 m with a minor horizontal component that formed graben structures inside Aso caldera; (iii) coseismic rupturing initiated at the jog area between the Hinagu and Futagawa faults, then propa- gated northeastward into Aso caldera, where it terminat- ed. The 2016 Mw 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake therefore offers a rare opportunity to study the relationships be- tween coseismic rupture processes and pre-existing ac- tive faults, as well as the seismotectonics of Aso volcano.",39.4,5343,1.48,7.93,5.796,1.621,0.28,3.43,2.002,0.508,0.28,3.43,1.979,0.488,0.98,3.02,2.117,0.621,-0.138,1.8,6.48,3.712,1.789,2.03,6.15,3.692,1.856,1.8,6.48,3.81,1.5,-0.118,8,45,7,9,15,54,36,1,NA,1.1,8,6.339,0.984,60,107,1,5367,98.45,31.11,65.83,15.25,31.76,32.07,60.98,45.5,37.49,2.91,0.39,0.2,0.17,0,0,0.02,2.52,13.25,10.12,0.43,14.78,2.85,1.77,5.11,0.13,4.43,4.29,3.6,1.17,0.28,0.24,0.61,5.18,0.04,5.12,1.38,0.91,0.09,0.56,0.04,1.75,0,1.1,0.3,0.75,0.24,0.13,0.11,0.09,0,0,0.06,0.88,0.48,0.06,0.04,0,0,0.26,0.37,0,0,0,0.02,0.22,0.02,0.02,0.19,1.83,0.04,0.04,1.55,0.11,0.11,0.22,0.06,0,0.04,0,0,0,0.04,0.02,0.04,0,0.15,0.02,0,0,0.07,0.09,0.26,0.56,16.34,0.75,0.56,14.01,1.45,0.02,0.06,2.55,2.37,2.03,0.04,0.34,0.24,0.09,0,0.11,3.15,3.13,0,0,0,0.02,0,0,0.789097707953759,-0.388900121294038,-0.474413237239322,-0.0742156505796009,39.02,-0.040492413977559,-1.54476970782281,0.761660076782029,0.189258835374669,0.411521303752919,-1.42438218414593,6.339

Methods: The total phenolic contents were determined by the method reported by S‡nchez-Moreno et al. The total flavonoid contents were analyzed by Slinkard and Singleton. The DPPH radical scavenging activity was de- termined according to the method reported by Blois Results: The extraction yield for each solvent is 9.05Ð 14.1%, 2.17Ð5.67%, and 2.3Ð3.9% for D.W., ethanol, and hexane, respectively. The overall results were maximized for the extract obtained with D.W. for 5 min at 100¡C. The average phenol contents were 77.11, 45.64, and 0.343 mg/g at 100¡C in water, 78¡C in ethanol, and 68¡C in hexane, respectively. The flavonoid contents were the highest in the materials extracted with D.W., and were increased with increasing temperature, regardless of the extraction solvents, whether water (green), polar organic ethanol, or nonpolar organic hexane. In the ethanol extract, the flavonoid contents are increased gradually from 5.66 mg/g to 7.73 mg/g. The total flavo- noid contents were proportional to the concentrations of the water extracts, ranging from 4.14 mg/g to 48.89 mg/g. The antioxidative activities of the water-extract- ed compounds are generally increased with increasing temperature from 42.5% to 85.5%. Those of the hexane extracts are increased slowly from 3.79% to 8.8%, while those of ethanol extracts are increased from 29.8% to 47.4%. Conclusion: The extraction yields were dependent upon solvents for extraction as well as extraction time and the temperature. The optimal extraction time was 5 min and the extraction yields were increased with increasing temperature excepted hexane. Of the three tested extraction solvents, the greenest solvent of water shows excellent results, suggesting that water is among the most effective solvents for natural sample extrac- tions for general medicinal, pharmaceutical, and food applications.",29.69,1272,0.97,8.45,6.546,1.818,0.18,3.95,2.582,0.851,1.78,3.95,2.616,0.706,0.18,3.53,2.323,1.861,0.292,1.41,6.06,3.142,1.323,1.41,4.86,2.971,1.153,2.11,6.06,4.457,2.077,-1.486,12,23,3,3,15,26,20,1,NA,3.93,7.78,6.034,1.073,24,29,1,1273,95.15,26.04,7.17,33.39,24.48,36.29,63.71,50.9,39.28,1.34,0.24,0,0,0,0,0.24,1.1,9.98,7.62,0.24,15,6.05,2.2,7.54,0.16,8.56,5.89,5.03,0.94,0.24,0.63,0.08,8.56,0.24,8.33,1.65,2.44,0.31,0.79,0.16,3.22,0,1.41,1.18,0.24,0.31,0.24,0.08,0,0,0,0,1.41,0.71,0.24,0.08,0,0,0.39,0.79,0.08,0.08,0.08,0,0.24,0.16,0,0.08,1.81,0,0.16,1.65,0,0,2.44,1.89,0.55,0.55,0,0,0,0.39,0,0.08,0,4.16,0,0.08,0,0.39,0.24,0.08,1.81,4.24,0.08,0.31,3.53,0.39,0,0.08,1.65,4.87,2.28,0.31,0.47,0.47,0,0,0,4.16,4.01,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,-0.347632882341075,-0.258163772131812,0.610846929533923,0.00505027506103695,36.29,0.00275545423202498,-0.291075955795908,0.396428107029305,0.684400869544075,-0.476181219802555,-0.100112044276098,6.034

Methods: From January 12 to February 03, 2020, an institutional-based cross-sectional study was used in South Gondar Zone hospitals. A total of 356 mothers delivered by vaginal were included. Data was collected using a questionnaire administered by the interviewer and entered into version 3.1 of EpiData, and then exported to SPSS version 23.0.0. To classify factors correlated with the outcome variables, logistic regression statistical analyses were used. Results: In the study area, the prevalence of early breastfeeding initiation among vaginally delivered mothers was 88.2%. Mothers who had unintended pregnancy [adjusted OR=6.00, 95% CI=2.8, 12.5], had professional guidance [adjusted OR=2.75, 95% CI=1.2, 5.6] and experience with breastfeeding [adjusted OR=1.79 95% CI=1.19, 2.68] among vaginal deliv- ered mothers were positively correlated with early breastfeeding initiation. Conclusion: The type of pregnancy and professional guidance among vaginally delivered mothers were significantly associated with early initiation of breastfeeding. Community- based education and counseling on breastfeeding for pregnant mothers and encouraging all mothers to start early breastfeeding.",34.9,2580,1.12,7.84,5.187,2.408,0.06,3.38,2.285,0.952,1.7,3.34,2.601,0.378,0.06,3.38,1.864,1.295,0.737,1.19,6.06,3.486,1.396,1.81,5.57,3.085,0.822,1.19,6.06,4.021,1.812,-0.936,9,20,11,15,20,35,5,1,NA,0.73,8.48,6.084,1.4,63,99,1,2580,97.56,68.78,36.65,33.79,27.74,30.89,82.09,54.5,43.64,2.91,1.01,0,0.04,0.04,0,0.35,1.9,14.61,8.64,2.52,16.82,5.62,1.59,5.7,0.12,9.73,5.04,5.97,2.95,1.16,0.93,0.89,8.88,0.5,8.37,2.56,2.36,0.31,1.4,0.12,1.86,0,2.29,1.55,0.58,0.66,0.16,0.35,0,0,0.04,0,10.19,3.02,0.78,0.08,0.04,0.08,1.09,6.82,3.88,0.39,2.98,0.5,0.16,0.04,0.08,0.04,4.92,0.04,0.04,4.65,0.12,0.08,6.09,2.67,1.16,0.12,0.08,0,1.24,0.47,0.54,0.12,0.04,1.59,0,0,0.04,0.27,0.23,0.16,2.98,8.57,0.16,0.39,7.36,0.54,0,0.12,4.38,5.66,1.16,0.5,0.47,0.43,0,0.04,0,3.95,3.57,0,0,0,0.35,0.04,0,0.116153198499218,0.823382389119328,1.32423473146878,2.26377031908733,17.91,1.2351239151677,-0.356628570280975,-2.06253292009709,0.324297571966325,0.000124665647910495,-1.5084598128246,6.084

Two discrete, but adjacent, areas of this cortex were activated when different parts of the tongue were electrically stimulated. These two areas were activated with different latencies suggesting a temporal as well as a spatial mapping of the periphery onto the cortex. The gustatory system of the hamster has been well characterized in the periphery using electrophysiological (Hyman and Frank, 1980a,b) and neuroanatomical (Whitehead and Beeman, 1983; Whitehead and Frank, 1983; Miller and Smith, 1984) techniques. In addition, there have been several electrophysiological and anatomical studies conducted on the central nervous system at the level of the brainstem (Travers and Smith, 1979, 1984; Hanamori et al., 1987; McPheeters et al., 1987; Whitehead, 1988). Although there are many studies describing the anatomy of the hamster insular cortex, which includes the gustatory cortex (Newman and Winans, 1980; Kevetter and Winans, 1981; Reep and Winans, 1982a,b), there are only a few preliminary reports describing the electrophysiology of the hamster gustatory cortex (Yamamoto et al., 1987; London, 1988a). The present experiments were undertaken to describe gustatory representations in the cortex of the hamster. Reported here are the findings that (i) recordings using voltage sensitive dyes may succesfully be obtained from the hamster cortex, (ii) specific regions of the hamster cortex become active as a result of application of gustatory stimuli to the hamster tongue and (iii) spatial and temporal differences exist in these gustatory regions.",37.84,1659,1.11,7,5.085,2.191,0.14,3.39,1.818,1.242,0.14,2.5,1.469,1.083,3.39,3.39,3.39,NA,-1.921,1.41,6.1,3.895,1.95,1.41,5.83,3.406,1.807,6.1,6.1,6.1,NA,-2.694,6,9,1,2,7,11,7,1,NA,3.04,7.8,5.874,1.167,28,33,1,1659,98.81,27.85,42.36,19.52,24.76,31.65,71.19,49.85,42.62,1.93,0.3,0.18,0,0,0,0.12,1.63,14.95,12.12,0.78,16.34,5.97,1.57,5.12,0.42,8.68,2.95,2.59,0.72,0,0.24,0.48,10.91,0.3,10.61,0.9,5.79,0.24,0.96,0,3.01,0,0.78,0.36,0.42,0.06,0.06,0,0,0,0,0,2.23,1.81,0.06,1.08,0.06,0,0.48,1.39,0,0,1.02,0.06,0.48,0,0.06,0.42,1.57,0,0,1.02,0.54,0,3.68,0.18,0.12,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,0.06,0,0.36,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,1.15,12.3,0.66,0.9,9.1,1.39,0.06,0.12,3.19,6.21,1.08,0.36,0.36,0.18,0,0.18,0,3.98,3.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.69848218018963,0.538139445492653,-1.24092566272252,0.995695962959756,28.81,0.543256480446896,2.45393977576627,-0.604280733172296,-0.125831550005861,0.268903802543183,2.24984327050355,5.874

Various control and treatment strategies have been suggested to prevent SWI. The construction of subsurface physical barriers is one of the most practical implementation methods to prevent SWI. In this work, the use of subsurface dam as a remediation and protection tool was investigated in a heteroge- neous aquifer via lab scale experiments and numerical simulation. The experiments depended on a novel automated imaged analysis method for SWI measurements. Glass beads of different grain sizes were used in sandbox experiments. The simulation works adopted the SEAWAT code for validation of the experimental results and making numerical sensitivity analyses for affecting parameters. Results proved the signiÞcant impact of using sub water dams with heterogonous aquifers. The remediation impacts of the dam was captured clearly in preventing and backwashing of the existed SWI. The results revealed also that the heterogeneous aquifers with high permeability in the bottom boundary behave closer to the homogenous aquifers in SWI than those having low hydraulic conductivity in the bottom. Sensitivity analyses results showed that the closer dam to seawater boundary led to the quicker and more effective backwashing process. Results exhibited also that the dam height with 50% of the aquifer dam has the ability to hold the seawater so long as the hydraulic gradient is high and dams with 67% of aquifer height prevent the saltwater intrusion completely.",48.03,5219,0.9,8.45,6.358,1.857,0.18,3.95,2.467,0.858,1.61,3.95,2.643,0.623,0.18,3.6,1.673,1.33,0.97,1.19,6.6,2.843,1.352,1.34,6.6,2.935,1.354,1.19,5.17,2.43,1.387,0.505,15,27,4,6,19,33,21,1,NA,2.04,8.17,6.203,1.193,81,158,1,5199,98.37,24.62,43.19,19.78,23.21,27.72,68.47,55.68,45.14,3.33,0.38,0,0.04,0,0,0.27,2.94,16.56,11.87,1.27,16.71,4.1,3.04,5.89,0.37,7.06,5.69,5.02,1.54,0.19,0.67,0.69,9.12,0.35,8.73,1.35,2.73,0.37,0.58,0.19,3.19,0,1.42,0.69,0.73,0.56,0.02,0.54,0.52,0,0,0.02,1.6,0.94,0.12,0,0.06,0,0.15,0.65,0,0,0.02,0,0.13,0.04,0,0.1,1.77,0,0.02,1.69,0.02,0.04,1.1,0.1,0,0,0,0,0.02,0.38,0,0.19,0.02,0.17,0.02,0.21,0,0.04,0.29,0.25,2.14,10.87,0.42,0.92,8.89,0.85,0,0.04,3.19,4.02,1.69,0.35,0.96,0.37,0.08,0.58,0,4.33,4.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.58480912116014,0.758014214538215,0.603257697598446,2.9460810332968,31.53,1.60739590477265,-0.0534477282875405,-0.240386609462623,-0.305883198794736,1.20048863416319,0.418956131654036,6.203

Demand grows to a peak and then declines as a market becomes saturated. The diffusion process is characterized as similar to the contagion process in the spread of disease. Holding con- stant price, demand growth is influenced by the relative importance of ""innovators"" and ""imitators"" in the population of consumers and by the contagion rate. When prices decline the adoption process is speeded up and the market for the product is expanded. When price depends upon experience, or accumulated output, profit optimizing behavior of firms, and upon the adoption process, the rate at which prices will fall will depend upon the learning rate parameter, demand elasticity and upon the parameters of the contagion process. A conceptual framework has been constructed to explore the relationship between diffusion rates, learning curves and de- mand with respect to SDI-related technological innovations.",46.61,2672,1.24,8.45,4.995,2.205,0.07,3.95,1.842,1.264,0.18,3.95,2.336,1.074,0.07,3.26,1.347,1.28,0.989,1.19,6.06,3.015,1.331,1.69,4.93,2.965,0.922,1.19,6.06,3.064,1.681,-0.099,12,14,9,14,21,28,0,1,NA,3,8.48,5.926,1.374,77,114,1,2672,95.15,33.29,27.92,30.41,24.51,30.05,77.73,58.2,46.29,3.67,0.56,0,0.37,0,0.07,0.11,3.11,14.41,10.14,0.64,15.49,7.49,3.14,5.65,0.34,9.92,6.1,6.59,3.71,0.75,0.6,2.47,11.53,0.22,11.26,3.89,1.91,0.67,2.62,0.45,2.62,0,1.31,1.01,0.26,0.15,0.07,0.04,0,0.04,0,0,4.42,2.69,0.07,0,0.11,0.07,0.97,1.38,0.07,0,0,0.07,2.69,0.71,0.07,1.91,7.22,0.07,0.04,4.19,3.11,0.04,1.05,0.75,0.41,0.04,0,0,0.07,0.04,0,0.26,0.04,0.49,0,0.07,0,0.37,0.15,1.35,2.88,6.92,0.3,0.45,5.88,0.34,0.07,0.07,2.81,1.61,4,1.8,0.07,0.07,0.04,0,0,4.08,4.04,0,0,0,0,0.04,0,0.798191552676118,0.0330217328204181,1.79476711146837,2.62598039696491,22.27,1.43274746634215,-0.725362026759477,-1.47923204532717,-0.0808186378086425,1.07067013947228,-1.76169810740813,5.926

One group consisted of 3 children with severe lymphoid atrophy and peripheral blood CD4ð T cell counts of <10/mm3. Another group was com- posed of 6 children with extensive hyperplasia of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues and blood CD4ð T cell counts >500/mm3. Hyperplastic bronchiole- and gut-associated lymphoid tissues were characterized by extensive networks of ger- minal center follicular dendritic cells (FDC) con- taining large amounts of immune-complexed virion RNA. Conversely, pulmonary and gastrointestinal tissues from children with severe CD4ð T cell de- pletion were devoid of any secondary lymphoid structures, yet these tissues also harbored high concentrations of HIV RNA. Dual in situ proce- dures showed that only macrophage (Mð) within these sites contained tat fusion transcripts, a prod- uct of post-transcriptional splicing and a correlate of productive infection. When examining explant cultures of Mð and FDC, only Mð harbored HIV tat mRNA and only Mð demonstrated budding ret- roviral particles. Hence, germinal center FDC in secondary lymphoid tissues are key reservoirs of immune-complexed HIV RNA and are likely to contribute to AIDS-associated lymphoprolifera- tions; however, these cells do not support HIV replication, and failure to do so results from a post-transcriptional block in the virus life cycle. Moreover, gut and pulmonary Mð represent a lin- eage of cells that are permissive to HIV replication and contribute signiÞcantly to the high viral load in children with severe CD4ð T cell depletion. It will be important to identify the molecular mechanisms that allow for these highly productive infections of peripheral blood lymphocytes",38.05,4015,0.59,8.45,4.44,2.64,0.18,3.95,2.53,0.646,1.78,3.95,2.532,0.512,0.18,3.91,2.528,0.764,0.004,1.41,6.06,3.852,1.403,1.41,4.74,2.943,0.887,1.8,6.06,4.717,1.255,-1.773,15,20,8,21,23,41,-1,1,NA,1.1,8.48,6.405,1.201,66,106,1,4018,92.31,34.53,13.22,26.41,24.5,33.42,59.73,42.19,34.4,2.79,0.55,0.02,0.25,0.12,0,0.15,2.24,6.92,3.53,0.15,15.01,4.38,2.09,6.45,0.57,6.02,4.78,3.16,1.67,0.32,1.07,0.32,8.14,0.37,7.77,1.77,1.57,0.4,1.05,0.07,2.71,0.07,1.57,0.97,0.5,0.05,0,0.02,0.02,0,0,0.07,2.99,0.85,0.17,0.07,0,0.02,0.37,2.04,0.02,0,0.05,0.02,0.25,0,0,0.25,1.54,0.05,0.02,1.17,0.05,0.25,7.37,6.3,3.66,0,0,0.02,2.02,0.05,0.1,0.02,0,0.2,0.12,0.1,0,0.37,0.05,0.3,1.84,8.21,0.9,0.22,6.1,1.02,0,0.05,1.54,3.93,1.17,0.17,0.62,0.42,0.05,0.2,0,4.08,4.06,0,0,0,0.02,0,0,-2.20732412806342,-0.252221210806256,-0.80833944240032,-3.26788478127,40.27,-1.78297356906173,-1.00396063832101,0.928890832163312,-0.395909023189173,0.288102312321416,-1.75023666435167,6.405

Moench, an economically important malvaceous vegetable crop popularly known as okra, is used in various culinary preparations and is rich in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. The biological properties of okra flowers in relation to nanoparticle synthesis have not yet been reported. Materials and Methods: In the current study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized using extracts of the flowers of A. esculentus. The characteristics of the AgNPs were studied using a UV-vis spectrometer, Fourier transmission infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Antibacterial activity screening was performed using the agar well diffusion method, and cytotoxicity and cell viability studies were conducted using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results: The synthesized AgNPs were spherical and ranged in size from 5.52 to 31.96 nm, with an average size of 16.19 nm, as determined by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, TEM and EDX. A. esculentus flower extract-mediated silver nanoparticles (AME-AgNPs) exhibited excellent activities in vitro studies, particularly in vitro cytotoxic and antiproliferative studies against cancer cell lines, such as the TERT-4 and A-549 cell lines. The antibacterial effects on the Gram-positive pathogens Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes and the Gram-negative pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella sonnei were tested. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values varied with the bacterial strain. The IC50 values of the synthesized NPs for the tested cell lines were close to that of a standard drug. Conclusion: Compared to other NPs the NPs synthesized in this study were smaller in size and exhibited a higher level of antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and apoptosis at minimal concen- trations, and this is the first study on okra flower-induced anticancer and antimicrobial activities.",33.48,3643,0.97,8.21,5.802,2.084,0.18,3.71,2.287,0.859,2.09,3.71,2.564,0.339,0.18,3.53,1.641,1.291,0.922,1.19,5.2,2.703,0.981,1.41,4.15,2.754,0.613,1.19,5.2,2.583,1.559,0.171,13,35,5,15,18,50,20,1,NA,3.64,8.32,6.539,1.052,62,105,1,3649,98.43,29.01,8.88,32.38,29.19,31.65,63.83,50.84,41.76,1.7,0.3,0.03,0.08,0,0,0.19,1.4,15.37,12.25,0.41,14.58,5.21,1.45,6.03,0.36,7.89,4.58,3.78,1.53,0.16,0.6,0.88,8.66,0.27,8.33,1.92,3.18,0.14,0.41,0.14,2.55,0,1.7,1.29,0.41,0.25,0.19,0.05,0.05,0,0,0,1.56,0.66,0.11,0.05,0.03,0,0.05,0.85,0,0,0.08,0.03,0.22,0.05,0,0.16,2.25,0,0.05,2.03,0.16,0,1.95,1.37,0.55,0.14,0,0.03,0.03,0.22,0.22,0.08,0,0.93,0,0.03,0,0.05,0.05,0.16,1.04,7.04,1.04,0.38,4.22,1.67,0,0.08,1.73,6.19,1.04,0.19,0.69,0.41,0.08,0.27,0,3.64,3.4,0,0,0,0.08,0.16,0,1.75759217088496,-0.507751347805152,-0.337807062400732,0.912033760679074,36.17,0.497609982672277,0.315285728190961,0.380373954512702,0.459336308557981,-0.129693829043003,0.863627185860962,6.539

A time-bound measurement at 15, 30 and 60 DAC revealed significant reduction in plant dry matter production, orchestrated through abnormally low capacity of leaf photosynthesis accompanied by low K+/Na+ ratio and onset of oxidative stress in all six genotypes at 15 DAC and the extension of the phenomena in PUSA-90-2 and WBK-CB-14 to 60 DAC. High superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity coupled with low ascorbate redox and declining ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalases (CAT) levels led to abnormal rise in H2O2 content at reproductive stage (30 DAC) in the latter two genotypes, consequently, resulting in NaCl- induced oxidative damage.

Despite a normal glutathione and ascorbate redox pool, the mutant suffered oxidative stress due to over-accumulation of H2O2 and consequent membrane damage by lipid peroxidation. Uniquely, this oxidative load was relieved in the mutant upon imposition to 20 and 40 µM sodium arsenate through consumption of excess cysteine to meet the growing demand for glutathione and subsequently, to confer tolerance to arsenate-induced oxidative stress. Both L-cysteine desulfhydrase and D-cysteine desulfhydrase activity was constitutively low in the mutant, even in response to external stress.

The plant has been widely recognized for its aporphine- type isoquinoline alkaloids, which are pharmacologically active. Thus, we conducted a combination of morphological and molecular data analysis on such species because of the plant species' relevance. One hundred seven randomly collected plants from 14 natural populations in 5 provinces were evaluated using ISSR markers and morphological traits. The evaluation of molecular variance (AMOVA) demonstrated significant genetic divergence between the examined populations. It indicated that 25% of overall genetic variability was related to intra-population variety, whereas 75% was due to inter- population genetic differentiation. ISSR primers discovered 156 bands, 139 (83 %) of which have been polymorphic, each primer containing an average of 13 bands. The Polymorphic Bands (PPB) Percentage (ISSR-6) varied from 50% to 100%.

Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) blocks T4 binding to plasma mem- branes and its pro-angiogenic effect. T4/T3 stimulates expression of Þbroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in endothelial cells. Thyroid hor- mone (T4/T3) is principally responsible for transcriptional activation mediated by nuclear thyroid hormone receptors TRb and TRa. In contrast, the hormone analogue GC-1 also stimulates transcriptional activation via TRb1. In the present study, we have deÞned the effect of GC-1, compared with T4 and T4-agarose, on angiogenesis in the CAM assay. GC-1 demonstrated a proangiogenic effect similar to that of T4 and T4-agarose. Tetrac inhibited GC-1- and T4-induced angio- genesis, indicating dependence on T4 and GC-1 binding to plasma membranes. The effects of GC-1, T4-agarose, and FGF2 were blocked by PD 98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitor. Additionally, the avb3 integrin antagonist XT199 inhibited angiogenesis induced by T4-agarose, GC-1, or FGF2.

Nonlinear site responses for the first shock and mainshock, which occurred on 14 and 16 April 2016, respec- tively, are important factors that explain why the area was heavily damaged. We analyzed soil nonlinearity using surface and borehole records obtained from the KiK-net KMMH16 (Mashiki) station. From our analysis, we found that S-wave veloc- ity models clearly depended on the amplitude of input ground motion. We estimated the strain-dependent shear stiffness and damping ratio to explain this S-wave velocity dependence. We conducted equivalent linear analyses at the KMMH16 site, based on a nonlinear model. From these analyses, we concluded that our synthetic surface ground motions agreed well with the observed ones, especially for the S-wave amplitudes and phases of the first shock and mainshock noted above. In addition, we performed the same analyses at the TMP3 site, which was actually located within one of the heavily damaged zones. The synthetic motions here also agreed with the observed ones, with differences in spectral accelerations being well explained by our analyses. Our results indicated that soil nonlinearity played a major role in causing the difference of ground motions, thus leading to the heavily damaged zone in the down- town area of Mashiki.",56.59,4731,1.48,7.1,4.08,2.44,0.18,3.02,2.335,0.758,1.86,2.6,2.441,0.2,0.18,3.02,2.266,0.959,0.175,1.19,4.79,3.192,1.22,1.66,3.1,2.487,0.326,1.19,4.79,3.647,1.367,-1.16,4,20,5,31,9,51,-11,1,NA,1.92,8.39,6.108,1.373,73,128,1,4748,99,39.69,44.64,18.74,23.27,24.37,66.49,52.99,44.5,2.86,1.31,0,1.12,0,0,0.19,1.56,17.4,12.66,2.06,16.24,3.52,2.04,5.2,0.27,5.62,5.98,5.71,1.96,1.33,0.13,0.51,7.52,0.27,7.25,1.79,1.35,0.13,0.93,0.11,2.74,0,1.41,0.63,0.76,0.04,0.02,0.02,0.02,0,0,0.02,2.8,1.1,0.04,0.23,0,0,0.48,1.85,0.08,0.02,0.32,0.02,0.17,0.13,0,0.04,0.97,0.02,0.17,0.72,0.06,0,0.34,0.17,0,0,0,0,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.06,0,0.15,0.06,0.06,0,0.02,0.02,0.19,0.95,13.63,0.78,2.63,8.74,1.83,0.02,0.25,1.6,3.31,2.06,0.23,0.34,0.23,0.08,0.02,0,4.4,4.32,0,0,0,0,0.08,0,1.94401598769331,0.478713832237095,1.12691470114638,3.54964452107678,33.51,1.93670303093889,-1.18423032815494,0.0245069070613305,-0.305883198794736,1.98305646131405,-0.900193652674036,6.108

The plant metal tolerance protein 6 (MTP6) proteins fall into the Fe/Zn-CDF subgroup; however, their function in iron/zinc transport has not yet been confirmed. Here, we characterized the MTP6 protein from cucum- ber, Cucumis sativus. When expressed in yeast and in protoplasts isolated from Arabidopsis cells, CsMTP6 localized in mitochondria and contributed to the efflux of Fe and Mn from these organelles. Immunolocalization of CsMTP6 in cucumber membranes confirmed this association with mitochondria. Root expression and protein levels of CsMTP6 were significantly up-regulated in conditions of Fe deficiency and excess, but were not affected by Mn availability. These results indicate that MTP6 proteins contribute to the distribution of Fe and Mn between the cytosol and mito- chondria of plant cells, and are regulated by Fe to maintain mitochondrial and cytosolic iron homeostasis under vary- ing conditions of Fe availability.",28.1,8811,0.97,7.72,4.616,2.617,0.54,3.53,2.494,0.723,0.54,3.22,2.306,0.654,1.58,3.53,2.74,0.748,-0.434,1.19,6.06,3.642,1.288,1.41,5.83,3.317,1.173,1.19,6.06,4.064,1.333,-0.747,15,30,12,23,27,53,7,1,NA,3.04,8.28,6.185,1.126,124,264,1,9004,97.57,30.95,12.1,20.23,35.73,30.98,53.52,44.54,37.76,2.41,0.53,0.03,0.34,0.03,0,0.12,1.88,11.16,8.31,0.51,15.35,4.1,1.34,5.82,0.42,5.93,3.2,2.99,1.64,0.7,0.48,0.51,7.92,0.18,7.73,1.92,2.08,0.51,1.14,0.12,2.63,0,0.77,0.38,0.38,0.08,0.01,0.06,0.04,0,0,0.02,1.9,0.86,0.22,0.08,0,0,0.37,1.1,0.01,0.11,0.16,0.02,0.36,0.04,0.03,0.28,0.93,0.09,0.04,0.79,0.03,0,0.54,0.38,0.02,0.08,0,0.03,0.01,0.08,0.03,0.21,0,0.33,0.42,0.31,0,0.14,0.13,0.1,0.92,7.33,0.4,0.18,6.14,0.53,0,0.13,1.28,2.88,1.63,0.48,0.63,0.36,0.14,0.28,0,2.98,2.89,0,0,0,0.07,0.02,0,-0.0338952394197004,-0.0501741257373622,-0.937356385303433,-1.0214257504605,46.48,-0.55729477558947,-0.586062720978709,1.75969322489753,-0.350896110991955,-0.621541365266324,1.58877320458763,6.185

The dye is hazardous and exposure to it may cause permanent injury to the cornea and conjunctiva including permanent blind- ness, and in severe cases, may lead to respiratory and kidney failure. The present work describes removal of Crystal violet from aqueous solution by adsorption on raw and acid-treated montmorillonite, K10. The clay mineral was treated with 0.25 and 0.50 M sulfuric acid and the resulting materials were charac- terized by XRD, zeta potential, SEM, FTIR, cation exchange capacity, BET surface area and pore volume measurements. The inßuences of pH, interaction time, adsorbent amount, and temperature on adsorp- tion were monitored and explained on the basis of physico-chemical characteristics of the materials. Basic pH generally favors adsorption but considerable removal was possible even under neutral condi- tions. Adsorption was very rapid and equilibrium could be attained in 180 min. The kinetics conformed to second order model. Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity of raw montmorillonite K10 was 370.37 mg gð1 whereas 0.25 M and 0.50 M acid treated montmorillonite K10 had capacities of 384.62 and 400.0 mg gð1 respectively at 303 K. Adsorption was exothermic and decreased in the temperature range of 293e323 K. Thermodynamically, the process was spontaneous with Gibbs energy decreasing with rise in temperature. The results suggest that montmorillonite K10 and its acid treated forms would be suitable for removing Crystal violet from aqueous solution.",46.2,5152,0.59,8.45,4.478,2.562,0.18,3.95,2.33,1.024,0.18,3.95,2.384,0.939,0.18,3.91,2.279,1.11,0.105,1.19,6.06,3.297,1.407,1.41,5.83,2.911,0.988,1.19,6.06,3.659,1.644,-0.748,17,30,18,32,35,62,-2,1,NA,1.97,8.46,6.143,1.241,114,173,1,5137,97.43,27.42,12.49,18.85,24.35,28.73,60.7,51.18,40.37,2.16,0.16,0.02,0,0.02,0,0.12,2.01,12.13,8.74,0.35,16.06,5.04,2.16,5.76,0.45,7.16,5.92,4.61,1.6,0.12,0.78,0.74,7.63,0.23,7.38,1.38,1.93,0.27,1.42,0.08,2.22,0,1.36,0.62,0.74,0.14,0,0.14,0,0.08,0,0.02,1.03,0.66,0.04,0.04,0.02,0.02,0.23,0.37,0,0.02,0,0,0.12,0,0,0.12,1.65,0.1,0.02,1.05,0.45,0.06,0.78,0.43,0.04,0.04,0,0,0.02,0.02,0,0.12,0,0.18,0.14,0.04,0,0.04,0.14,0.06,1.42,8.49,0.51,0.49,6.03,1.58,0.02,0.12,1.91,2.96,2.61,0.49,1.03,0.86,0.62,0.16,0,4.13,4.09,0,0,0,0.02,0.02,0,0.161622422111011,0.371747728377093,0.29209918824388,0.825469338731983,39.3,0.450380019964477,-0.70897387313821,0.799119765987435,-0.395909023189173,1.03318733466715,-0.0967523986642789,6.143

Four lab and field studies demonstrate that death-related media contexts affect subsequent brand evaluations in distinct ways, which have not yet been documented in the extant literature on media context. First, death-related media contexts shift consumersÕ preferences in favor of domestic brands by enhancing consumersÕ patriotism. Second, the death-related media context effect appears only with a temporal delay between the media context and the brand evaluation. Even after a 24-hour delay, the effect still takes place as long as consumers have not been given an opportunity to attenuate death-induced anxiety. Finally, the authors show that foreign brands can counter the negative effects of a death-related media context by making a prodomestic advertising claim.",39.47,8298,1.12,8.27,5.909,2.044,0.06,3.77,2.363,0.733,0.7,3.77,2.525,0.53,0.06,3.38,1.884,1.012,0.641,1.19,8.03,4.176,1.533,1.41,8.03,4.26,1.412,1.19,7.03,3.929,1.861,0.331,23,62,17,21,40,83,41,1,NA,1.93,8.39,6.204,1.147,153,353,1,8301,90.84,39.5,42.19,27.57,22.44,33.92,76.15,53.22,42.65,5.79,2.26,0.05,1.19,0.01,0.02,0.81,3.53,15.44,9.55,0.96,12.5,4.3,3.39,6.41,1.17,7.1,7.71,3.45,3.61,1.33,1.05,1.3,16.05,0.22,15.78,6.22,3.93,1.6,1.36,0.37,4.26,0.02,3.02,1.75,1.19,0.82,0.07,0.66,0.48,0.06,0.02,0,7.99,3.43,0.57,0.05,0.23,0.63,0.99,4.18,0.01,0.02,0.07,0.05,0.6,0.06,0.19,0.35,3.98,0.49,0.01,2.94,1.02,0.17,2.88,0.05,0,0,0.02,0.1,0,0.22,2.59,0.08,0.01,0.3,0.12,0.42,0,0.39,0.18,0.39,1.77,6.52,0.65,0.29,4.57,0.96,0,0.13,3.28,2.67,2.1,0.66,0.16,0.13,0.01,0.01,0,5.35,4.34,0,0.1,0.01,0.57,0.34,0,0.529923133366537,-1.74380410352074,-0.58825171627148,-1.80213268642568,23.85,-0.983252214476937,0.929841488988464,-1.26785237052523,-0.0808186378086425,0.41792080701233,-1.65836526521739,6.204

A total of 63 analysts participated in a two (firm size: small and large) by two (firm health: unhealthy and healthy) randomized between-subjects design. The ERP announcement represented a within-subjects manipulation. The analystsÕ overall reaction to ERP implementation plans was positive, as mean post-announcement earnings forecasts were significantly higher than mean pre-announcement forecasts. Addi- tionally, as expected, mean earnings forecast revisions in the small/healthy and large/un- healthy firm conditions were significantly greater than mean forecast revisions in the small/ unhealthy firm condition. Experimental results from the current study support archival findings reported by Hayes et al. (2001), who explored the same research questions, among others, by examining cumu- lative abnormal returns surrounding ERP announcements. Triangulation studies of this na- ture using multimethods (e.g., behavioral vs. archival) and complementary criterion vari- ables (e.g., earnings forecasts vs. cumulative abnormal returns) are important to social sci- entists, as they provide insight into the reliability, consistency, and validity (both internal and ecological) of proposed theoretical relationships (Boyd et al. 1993; Flick 1992; Libby et al. 2002).",29.59,4253,1.24,8.22,4.332,2.924,0.18,3.72,2.783,0.852,0.82,3.72,2.893,0.816,0.18,3.26,2.693,0.88,0.2,1.19,6.06,3.61,1.642,1.79,5.04,2.763,0.648,1.19,6.06,4.309,1.878,-1.546,10,33,8,40,18,73,-7,1,NA,0.9,8.38,6.11,1.374,96,233,1,4255,93.93,31.52,32.26,21.38,24.45,37.09,75.86,54.15,39.34,3.85,1.55,0.02,0.96,0.05,0,0.47,2.3,13.37,8.46,1.1,13.21,4.37,2.77,6.3,0.49,7.61,8.84,5.99,3.41,1.22,0.8,1.43,17.81,0.24,17.56,4.89,4.89,1.36,1.79,0.19,4.47,0.05,1.27,0.66,0.56,0.14,0,0.09,0,0.07,0,0,5.48,2.87,0.19,0.12,0.09,0,1.43,2.44,0,0.02,0,0.05,0.12,0.02,0,0.09,9.26,0,0,7.07,3.62,0.02,1.15,1.08,0,0.4,0,0,0,0.02,0,0.12,0,0.24,0.21,0.19,0,1.03,0.26,0.35,1.29,5.73,0.68,0.8,4.07,0.35,0,0.02,2.7,2.68,1.83,1.41,0.09,0,0,0.09,0,4.75,4.02,0,0.07,0,0.24,0.42,0,0.0343085959979898,-1.32188224940628,1.33941319533974,0.0518395419314446,24.14,0.0282839020597637,1.71647286280927,-1.22905483527677,-0.395909023189173,-0.485323367315999,1.39693432009743,6.11

Targeting microRNA (miRNA) activity in adult osteoblasts may be a successful therapeutic strategy for age-related bone loss. We investigated the mechanism_s) by which miRNAs negatively regulate osteoblastogenesis and bone formation in vitro and in vivo. Methods: we performed a miRNA microarray screen followed by PCR validation in adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells during the proliferation-to-mineralization transition to identify downregulated miRNAs, most notably miR-451. Primary human calvarial pre-osteoblasts were isolated and transfected with miR-451's agomir or antagomir for in vitro assays. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro ex- periments verified YWHAZ as a miR-451 target gene. We next investigated the effects of YWHAZ knock- down on osteoblastic differentiation. To examine the effects of miR-451's antagomir in vivo, we injected ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated mice with miR-451's antagomir over a period of six weeks. We isolated stromal cells from murine bone marrow on week six for further ex vivo experimentation. Results: miR-451's antagomir stimulated pre-osteoblast differentiation into a more differentiated, mineralized phe- notype. This phenotype was associated with upregulated RUNX2, ALP, and COL1A1 protein expression. miR-451's antagomir derepresses YWHAZ expression, thereby enhancing RUNX2 protein stability and pro- moting osteoblastic differentiation. When injected in vivo, miR-451's antagomir promotes osteoblastogene- sis and mineralization, reversed OVX-induced bone loss, and increased bone strength in OVX and sham- operated mice. Conclusions: miR-451 suppresses osteoblastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. miR-451 inhibi- tion may serve as an effective anabolic therapeutic strategy in senile osteoporosis patients.",27.05,3332,1.24,8.22,6.527,1.51,1.64,3.72,2.477,0.426,1.64,3.72,2.419,0.381,3.26,3.26,3.26,NA,-0.841,1.41,6.06,3.274,1.132,1.41,5.57,3.068,0.86,6.06,6.06,6.06,NA,-2.992,13,27,1,2,14,29,25,1,NA,3.93,8.17,6.431,1.063,49,92,1,3339,93.77,40.96,12.13,22.47,27.15,34.59,55.38,39.68,30.94,2.94,1.02,0.09,0.84,0.06,0,0.03,1.92,9.1,5.48,0.69,11.8,3.8,1.11,5.36,0.36,6.95,3.65,3.41,3.47,0.99,0.93,1.59,8.21,0.48,7.73,2.64,2.67,0.09,0.6,0.03,2.4,0,1.62,0.9,0.72,0.03,0.03,0,0,0,0,0,3.89,1.62,0.39,0.12,0,0.12,0.39,2.1,0,0,0.09,0,0.57,0.06,0,0.51,2.07,0.09,0.09,1.71,0.09,0.09,3.38,0.81,0.36,0.03,0,0.06,0,0.45,0.09,0.09,0,0.36,0,0,0,0.06,0.27,0.15,1.47,6.05,0.24,0.21,4.19,1.38,0,0.09,2.25,5.03,0.72,0.36,0.42,0.33,0.03,0.09,0,3.68,3.65,0,0,0,0.03,0,0,-1.32067426763345,-2.15978339630964,-0.618608644013389,-4.09906630795648,44.62,-2.23647018609926,-0.102612189151341,1.51085386089018,-0.260870286597517,-0.717533914157493,0.150175686394585,6.431

Major models of search presume that working memory (WM) provides the on-line work space for evaluating potential targets. According to this hypothesis, individuals with higher WM capacity should search more efficiently, because they should be able to apprehend a larger number of search elements at a time. Nevertheless, no compelling evidence of such a correlation has emerged, and this null result challenges a growing consensus that there is strong overlap between the neural processes that limit internal storage and those that limit external selection. Here, we provide multiple demonstrations of robust correlations between WM capacity and search efficiency, and we document a key boundary condition for observing this link. Finally, examination of a neural measure of visual selection capacity (the N2pc) demonstrates that visual search and WM storage are constrained by a common discrete resource.",36.12,4184,1.24,8.16,4.977,1.894,0.18,3.66,1.659,1.005,0.28,3.66,1.586,0.975,0.18,3.26,1.81,1.081,-0.224,1.34,6.06,3.203,1.327,1.34,5.83,3.144,1.218,1.35,6.06,3.326,1.562,-0.183,16,33,12,16,28,49,17,1,NA,0.73,8.38,5.822,1.572,94,156,1,4191,93.05,28.15,43.73,27.84,26.36,30.92,72.51,51.49,40.85,4.46,0.98,0,0.72,0,0,0.26,3.48,14.44,8.97,0.69,12.72,5.51,2.55,5.56,0.64,8.06,5.89,4.22,3.34,0.95,1.74,0.74,13.7,0.38,13.29,3.25,3.08,0.91,1.72,0.26,4.34,0.12,1.19,0.88,0.31,0.07,0.02,0.05,0.02,0.02,0,0,4.18,2.2,0.17,0.24,0.17,0,1.07,2.1,0.05,0.05,0.29,0,0.14,0,0,0.14,2.62,0.05,0,2.24,0.36,0.1,0.36,0.02,0,0.02,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,0,0,0.1,0.05,0,0.12,0.21,0.12,1.77,14.87,4.44,0.43,7.87,2.27,0,0.12,2.27,4.68,1.74,0.67,0.64,0.6,0,0.05,0,4.01,3.77,0,0,0,0.1,0.14,0,0.266201636418136,-1.61306775435851,-0.00388085723973319,-1.35074697518011,27.49,-0.736974011152335,0.233344960084627,-0.780876410854933,-0.305883198794736,0.111658865311935,-1.09028112843984,5.822

We, too, have shown that a significant number of patients with severe thermal injuries are profoundly immunosuppressed. This immunosuppression was mediated by substances which circulate in the serum which could be easily detected using in vitro lymphocyte assays. The suppressive material was not present in normal serum, and exerted its effects through the activity of a specific (suppressor) subpopulation of lymphocytes. In this study, we have analyzed serum samples obtained from burn patients by plasmapheresis for suppressive activity, then fractionated each using Sephadex G-200. Individual fractions were tested for suppressive activity in mixed lymphocyte cultures, and approximate molecular weights established for suppressive peaks by means of chromatography calibration standards.

Recently, however, an immortalized human trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVNeo) was demonstrated to respond to Ang II. Therefore, we utilized this cell line to characterize the AT1R expressed on the cell surface and to investigate the mechanisms by which the hAT1R gene is regulated in these cells. HTR-8/SVNeo cells were shown to express functional high affinity AT1Rs having a Bmax value of 114F11 fmol/mg protein and a Kd value of 0.14F0.1 nM. Additionally, Ang II- induced IP3 production was mediated via the AT1R. Deletional analysis of the hAT1R promoter localized a major basal regulatory sequence within the ð105 to ð79 bp region, relative to the transcription start site, in HTR-8/SVNeo cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that the transcription factors, Sp1 and Sp3, interact with this region of the hAT1R promoter in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our data demonstrate that HTR-8/SVNeo cells express functional AT1Rs and that basal level expression of this gene is regulated, in part, by Sp1 and Sp3 in this cell line.",37.84,6549,1.24,8.45,5.623,2.232,0.18,3.95,2.332,0.814,1.95,3.95,2.468,0.563,0.18,3.26,2.014,1.204,0.453,1.41,6.06,3.211,1.29,1.41,4.93,2.818,1.059,2.11,6.06,4.13,1.369,-1.312,13,21,7,9,20,30,12,1,NA,3.03,8.48,6.46,1.185,91,195,1,6605,94.33,30.61,11.83,24.07,24.65,33.81,58.96,43.91,36.81,3.56,0.61,0.17,0.35,0,0,0.09,2.95,11.88,7.49,0.62,13.13,5.39,1.64,5.22,0.47,7.45,3.91,2.53,3.32,0.61,1.45,1.64,8.68,0.33,8.34,1.54,3.47,0.53,0.91,0.08,2.39,0,0.71,0.5,0.2,0.08,0.02,0.05,0.02,0.03,0,0.02,3.16,2.1,0.2,0.03,0.03,0.02,0.86,1,0.14,0.02,0.12,0,0.67,0.11,0.02,0.55,4.04,0.11,0.03,3.33,0.11,0.47,0.74,0.51,0.15,0,0,0,0.03,0.08,0.02,0.21,0,0.71,0.11,0.12,0,0,0.02,0.17,0.89,6.4,0.3,0.17,5.71,0.15,0,0.14,2.15,4.62,1.54,0.38,0.7,0.23,0.03,0.47,0,4.13,4.04,0,0,0,0.09,0,0,-0.406742873036406,-1.36942274001073,-1.28646105433539,-3.06262666738252,41.04,-1.67098376024277,0.552913955699329,1.03190497747818,-0.305883198794736,0.268903802543183,-0.0491854308137031,6.46

Methods: Glm nanosuspensions were fabricated using optimized processing conditions. Characterization of Glm was performed using Malvern Zetasizer, scanning electron micro- scopy, transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and powder X- ray diffraction. Minimum particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) values were found to be 152.4±2.42 nm and 0.23±0.01, respectively, using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose: 6 cPs, 1% w/v, polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 1% w/v, and sodium lauryl sulfate 0.12% w/v, keeping ultrasonication power input at 400 W, with 15 minutes' processing at 3-second pauses. In vivo oral bioavailability was assessed using rabbits as a model. Results: The saturation solubility of the Glm nanosuspensions was substantially enhanced 3.14- fold and 5.77-fold compared to unprocessed drug in stabilizer solution and unprocessed active pharmaceutical ingredient. Also, the dissolution rate of the nanosuspensions ws substantially boosted when compared to the marketed formulation and unprocessed drug candidate. The results showed that >85%of Glm nanosuspensions dissolved intheÞrst 10 minutescomparedto 10.17% of unprocessed Glm), 42.19% of microsuspensions, and 19.94% of marketed tablets. In-vivo studies conducted in animals, i.e. rabbits, demonstrated that maximum concentration and AUC0Ð24 with oral dosing were twofold (5 mg/kg) and 1.74-fold (2.5 mg/kg) and 1.80-fold (5 mg/kg) and 1.63- fold (2.5 mg/kg), respectively, and compared with the unprocessed drug formulation. In-vitro _- glucosidase inhibition results showed that fabricated nanosuspensions had a pronounced effect compared to unprocessed drug. Conclusion: The optimized batch fabricated by ultrasonication-assisted precipitation can be useful in boosting oral bioavailability, which may be accredited to enhanced solubility and dissolution rate of Glm, ultimately resulting in its faster rate of absorption due to nanonization.",28.47,2339,4.19,7.57,6.732,0.613,0.31,3.07,2.258,0.505,1.61,3.07,2.343,0.294,0.31,0.31,0.31,NA,2.033,1.34,4.93,2.623,0.824,1.34,4.93,2.671,0.808,1.52,1.52,1.52,NA,1.151,11,23,1,1,12,24,22,1,NA,3.07,8.15,6.408,1.213,47,72,1,2349,97.68,33.55,25.65,53.91,26.1,35.38,61.73,49.81,36.57,1.45,0.13,0.04,0,0,0,0.04,1.32,8.6,6.64,0.6,16.73,5.32,1.66,5.15,0,8.68,3.66,5.07,2.13,0.09,1.45,0.68,7.58,0.13,7.45,2,2.89,0.17,0.6,0.13,1.49,0,2.38,2.26,0.09,0.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.15,0.72,0.26,0,0,0.09,0.17,0.38,0,0,0,0,0.34,0.13,0,0.21,1.66,0.13,0.13,1.06,0.47,0,2.17,1.45,0.13,0.04,0,0.04,0,0.13,0,0.09,0.04,0.3,0.04,0,0,0.09,0.13,0.04,0.85,7.79,0.34,0.85,5.28,1.28,0.04,0.17,5.02,5.92,1.19,0.77,1.79,1.62,0.3,0.17,0,4.04,3.83,0,0,0,0.13,0.09,0,-0.79323127373665,0.769899337189326,0.641203857275833,0.617871920728509,38.27,0.337113875629423,0.0776575006825935,0.661321623553258,-0.395909023189173,-0.587715419466579,2.05971744252103,6.408

Although the production and toxic effects of m-tyrosine are known, its microbial degradation has not been documented yet. A soil microcosm study showed efficient degradation of m-tyrosine by the inhabitant microorganisms. A bacterial strain designated SSC5, that was able to utilize m-tyrosine as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy, was isolated from the soil microcosm and was characterized as Bacillus aquimaris. Analytical methods such as HPLC, GC-MS, and 1H-NMR performed on the resting cell samples identified the formation of 3- hydroxyphenylpyruvate (3-OH-PPA), 3-hydroxyphenylacetate (3-OH-PhAc), and homogentisate (HMG) as major intermedi- ates in the m-tyrosine degradation pathway. Enzymatic assays carried out on cell-free lysates of m-tyrosine-induced cells confirmed transamination reaction as the first step of m-tyrosine degradation. The intermediate 3-OH-PhAc thus obtained was further funneled into the HMG central pathway as revealed by a hydroxylase enzyme assay. Subsequent degradation of HMG occurred by ring cleavage catalyzed by the enzyme homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase.

Generally, amount of individual phenolic compounds and organic acids were increased with altitude increase while general phytochemical characteristics such as total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were decreased. Heritabilities of general characteristics were found lower, due to high difference between genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) and phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) than organic and phenolic acids.

Their re- sponse to phenylephrine was reduced to 18 6 7% and 65 6 11% of controls during and after the exposure, respectively, and their sub- sequent relaxation was irregular. NAC 0.25 mM best attenuated the IR-induced aortic tone impairments, 0.12 mM affected it slightly, and IR-NAC 0.5 mM and IR-NAC 0.74 mM solutions dilated the rings proportionately, abolishing reactions to both IR solutions and phen- ylephrine. Xanthine oxidase activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) level in all IR ring tissues were inversely proportionate, but not directly so. Thus, liver IR impaired aortic tone and its response to phenylephrine, even after removal of toxic elements. NAC concen- trations directly and inversely correlated with xanthine oxidase activity but not with GSH level. It preserved aortic functions dose- speciÞcally, mainly by oxidant quenching.",42.34,3954,0.97,7.63,4.145,2.59,0.18,3.53,2.473,0.777,1.6,3.13,2.455,0.473,0.18,3.53,2.486,0.953,-0.032,1.19,6.06,3.67,1.595,1.34,4.92,3.165,1.468,1.19,6.06,4.053,1.604,-0.888,13,22,16,29,29,51,-7,1,NA,3.52,8.17,6.274,1.118,66,125,1,3958,98.43,29.29,39.47,30.56,27.11,29.79,66.17,51.52,42.32,2.7,0.56,0,0.2,0,0,0.3,2.15,15.31,11.55,0.1,15.87,4.17,2.2,5.81,0.45,6.85,4.67,3.79,2.35,0.25,1.01,1.16,11.22,0.86,10.36,2.15,3.56,0.61,0.78,0.1,3.61,0,1.87,1.31,0.56,0.45,0.4,0.05,0.03,0,0,0,3.06,1.06,0.28,0,0,0.03,0.48,1.92,0.05,0.03,0.05,0.05,0.23,0.05,0.03,0.15,2.35,0.81,0,1.26,0.05,0.23,2.58,1.09,0.1,0.05,0.03,0.03,0,0,0,0.13,0,0.25,0.2,0.13,0,0,0.4,0.05,1.62,7.98,0.25,0.96,6.42,0.66,0,0.4,4.12,4.9,0.99,0.18,0.25,0.03,0,0.23,0,4.24,3.66,0,0,0,0.43,0.15,0,1.4393076056024,0.258839063191535,-0.330217830465254,1.36792883832868,33.83,0.746348517878131,0.626660646995029,0.0673179804389382,1.40460746469957,0.680300440648192,-0.644580760035667,6.274

The frictional and viscous effects are specified by the characteristic dis- placement, Uc, and viscosity coefficient, _, respectively. Simulation results show that friction and viscosity can both lengthen the natural period of the system and viscosity increases the duration time of motion of the slider. Higher viscosity causes a smaller amplitude of lower velocity motion than lower viscosity. A change of either Uc (under large _) or _ (under large Uc) from a large value (Uch for Uc and _h for _) to a small one (Ucl for Uc and _l for _) in two stages during sliding can result in a clear nucleation phase prior to the P-wave. The differences _Uc = Uch _ Ucl and __ = _h _ _l are two important factors in producing a nucleation phase. The difference between the nucleation phase and the P-wave increases with either _Uc or __. Like seismic observa- tions, the peak amplitude of P-wave, which is associated with the earthquake magnitude, is independent upon the duration time of nucleation phase. A mechanism speci- fied with a change of either _ or Uc from a larger value to a smaller one due to temporal variations in pore fluid pressure and temperature in the fault zone based on radiation efficiency is proposed to explain the simula- tion results and observations.",54.97,9632,0.59,7.93,5.644,2.17,0.18,3.91,2.264,0.917,1.61,3.43,2.407,0.596,0.18,3.91,1.919,1.387,0.488,1.19,5.85,3.332,1.249,1.34,4.15,3.231,1.048,1.19,5.85,3.579,1.644,-0.348,10,51,12,21,22,72,30,1,NA,1.93,8.28,5.829,1.221,126,280,1,9670,97.59,26.85,29.42,17.02,24.67,23.19,66.56,54.33,44.55,2.61,0.57,0.04,0.05,0.34,0.04,0.08,2.04,14.98,11.38,1.2,15.75,4.4,3.19,6.96,0.38,7.66,5.27,4.82,3.06,0.24,0.47,2.61,9.7,0.08,9.62,1.62,3.42,0.78,1.41,0.26,2.97,0,1.44,0.58,0.86,0.48,0,0.48,0.46,0,0.02,0.13,1.32,0.62,0.03,0.03,0,0,0.33,0.7,0,0,0.02,0.05,0.19,0.03,0,0.16,0.88,0.04,0,0.83,0.06,0.01,0.48,0.16,0,0.01,0.01,0,0,0.13,0,0.11,0.04,0.12,0.07,0.04,0,0,0.09,0.16,2.04,9.09,0.36,2.17,5.51,1,0,0.26,3.64,2.01,3.74,0.36,0.85,0.67,0.06,0.18,0,4.12,4.04,0,0,0,0.05,0.02,0,1.36200992546236,0.187528327284866,0.451473058888901,2.00101131163612,33.44,1.0917613437565,0.511943571646162,0.0151419847599776,-0.395909023189173,1.83495367159625,0.179802251755567,5.829

Methods: In this study, BV and SBV were examined for antifungal activities against the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) strain and 10 clinical isolates of C. albicans. The disk diffusion method was used to measure the antifungal activity and minimum inhibito- ry concentration (MIC) assays were performed by using a broth microdilution method. Also, a killing curve as- say was conducted to investigate the kinetics of the an- ti-fungal action. Results: BV and SBV showed antifungal activity against 10 clinical isolates of C. albicans that were cultured from blood and the vagina by using disk diffusion method. The MIC values obtained for clinical isolates by using the broth microdilution method varied from 62.5 _g/ mL to 125 _g/mL for BV and from 15.63 _g/mL to 62.5 _g/mL for SBV. In the killing-curve assay, SBV behaved as amphotericin B, which was used as positive control, did. The antifungal efficacy of SBV was much higher than that of BV.

Family planning is one component of maternal health-care service that needs attention during this devastating time. Compromise on family planning services and the preventive strategies of COVID-19 might increase the burden of unintended pregnancy, but there is limited evidence that shows the magnitude of unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among women attend- ing antenatal care in northwest Ethiopia. Methods: This study was an institutional-based cross-sectional study, including 424 women attending antenatal care from November 12/2020 to December 12/2020. The study partici- pants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. A pretested questionnaire was used. Binary logistic regression (bivariable and multivariable) was employed. The adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to declare statistically sig- nificant variables based on p<0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. Results: The magnitude of unintended pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic among women attending antenatal care was found to be 47.17% (42.2Ð52.2%). Women did not expose to community education (AOR=2.2; 95% CI1.1Ð4), women with no bad obstetric history (AOR=2.3; 95% CI1.3Ð4.1), a woman was not the primary decision maker for family planning service (AOR=2.9; 95% CI 1.5Ð5.7), no complication during index pregnancy (AOR=5.4; 95% CI 2.2Ð13) and women with no health-care provider support (AOR=2.4, 95% CI1.4Ð3.9) were significantly associated with unintended pregnancy. Conclusions: The magnitude of unintended pregnancy was found to be high. Community education about maternal health services including family planning, improving womenÕs decision-making power for maternal health-care services, giving emphasis on pregnancy- related complications with health-care provider support, and pregnant women with bad obstetric history were suggested to reduce the problem.",23.29,1662,0.59,7.79,3.31,2.708,0.38,3.91,2.715,0.977,1.7,3.29,2.286,0.598,0.38,3.91,2.929,1.082,-0.643,1.19,5.85,3.977,1.618,1.84,5.1,3.308,1.497,1.19,5.85,4.311,1.644,-1.003,4,5,5,10,9,15,-5,1,NA,1.97,7.68,5.548,1.333,35,63,1,1662,95.59,67.87,26.63,23.26,30.78,34.54,78.64,52.95,40.61,2.95,1.14,0,0.12,0,0.06,0.36,1.81,11.73,7.46,0.9,15.58,6.38,1.68,4.99,1.08,10.83,5.54,5.23,2.65,0.6,1.5,0.6,11.25,0.72,10.47,2.95,1.2,1.08,2.35,0,3.01,0,3.13,1.62,1.38,0.9,0.12,0.66,0,0,0,0,11.67,2.41,1.38,0,0.06,0,0.6,8.72,4.03,0.06,2.65,0,0.12,0,0.06,0.06,3.19,0,0.18,2.89,0.12,0.06,6.92,6.32,1.44,0.06,0,0,4.03,0,0.12,0.42,0.24,0.66,0.12,0.18,0,0.06,0.42,0.06,2.71,5.29,0.18,0.24,4.75,0.12,0,0,4.87,4.99,2.17,1.56,0.3,0.3,0.24,0,0,3.25,3.13,0,0.06,0,0.06,0,0,-0.420383640119944,0.0865047847504194,0.762631568243468,0.428752712873944,21.36,0.233929531144811,-1.30714148031445,-1.60097603524475,0.144245923177451,-1.06127866066301,-1.75715524692882,5.548

This theory is validated via the investigation of the swelling of dextran microgels in sugar solutions, which can be viewed as a model system for cross- linked starch in sugar solution and custard. An essential part of our modiÞed theory is that starch perceives the sugar solution as an e_ective solvent rendering a certain hydrogen bond density. Our simulations show that the often experimentally observed maximum in swelling of starch at 20% sugar concentration is probably due to the fact that equilibrium is not reached within practical time scales. Also, we discuss the use of our theory as a tool in sugar reformulation issues of custard.

Analysis of the data indicates the distribution of thresholds is significantly different from that in the London sample of Harris and Kalmus in that the frequency of nontasters is about half that found in London. The difference is not attributed to the modifications made in the testing procedure but to a real difference in gene frequency. Both the PTC taster and nontaster phenotypes display a large amount of variation in expression between individuals. They are differently expressed in males and females, the latter being more sensitive. As people age, the expressions of their genotypes change. Neither age nor sex seem to affect the penetrance of the PTC genes which remains the same within each sex at all ages unless some other environmental factor, such as radiation, impinges. Consideration of these relationships is necessary for the investigation of family relationships, the mechanisms responsible for maintaining this ancient genetic polymorphism and the degree of polytypy present in the species.",48.54,5661,0.59,8.16,3.812,2.21,0.06,3.91,2.003,1.139,0.54,3.66,1.76,1.009,0.06,3.91,2.147,1.197,-0.386,1.19,6.63,4.117,1.8,1.58,5.83,4.021,1.614,1.19,6.63,4.175,1.917,-0.154,14,28,18,47,32,75,-19,1,NA,1.57,8.24,6.157,1.439,150,240,1,5662,96.42,34.53,56.63,24.04,22.56,29.44,78.38,60.21,49.63,3.97,1.08,0.04,0.23,0.04,0.25,0.37,2.9,17.63,11.07,1.68,16.71,6.32,2.67,6.66,0.9,10.14,5.37,5.81,2.58,0.65,0.92,1.02,14.11,0.6,13.51,4.2,2.3,0.53,2.15,0.3,4.72,0,1.38,0.83,0.53,0.23,0.09,0.12,0.02,0.04,0,0,6.23,1.71,0.16,0.04,0.26,0.02,0.78,4.42,0.39,0,0.51,0.88,0.32,0.07,0.21,0.04,2.12,0,0.02,1.94,0.16,0.05,1.82,0.26,0.07,0.02,0,0,0.35,0.87,0.05,0.21,0.05,0.21,0.16,0.16,0.04,0.07,0.09,0.04,2.12,9.18,0.26,0.62,6.61,0.81,0,0.32,3.64,4.7,2.88,0.44,0.05,0.04,0.02,0,0,4.42,4.4,0,0.02,0,0,0,0,1.2210553322658,0.758014214538215,1.20280702050115,3.18187656730516,21.62,1.73604707608975,-0.405793031144775,-1.56619203812544,0.00920718658579472,1.24711358648176,-1.49225876624802,6.157

It compares and synthesizes data from two attitudinal surveys of Eureka participants. It argues that firms are motivated to participate in Eureka as much or more by its ability to encourage new collaborative links than its provision of public funding. While industrial attitudes toward Eureka generally are positive, its methodology causes problems for the management of projects, especially those led by small firms. The paper argues that Eureka should be reformed to harmonize its funding procedures, provide more non-financial support to its participants, become more selec- tive in choosing projects for Eureka status, and strengthen links with the European CommunityÕs research programmes.

These findings suggest that trait and state self-objectification may be part of a wider pattern of system-justifying behavior that maintains gender inequality and thwarts womenÕs pursuit of social justice.",14.02,3697,0.69,8.07,4.379,2.283,0.18,3.81,2.028,0.99,0.47,3.57,2.179,0.965,0.18,3.81,1.911,1.021,0.268,1.19,6.9,3.174,1.971,2.27,6.42,3.786,1.205,1.19,6.9,2.697,2.33,1.089,10,14,6,18,16,32,-4,1,NA,3.68,8.38,6.235,1.155,86,127,1,3707,94.74,60.13,31.28,31.34,31.15,33.61,74.48,50.88,40.33,5.4,2.24,0.43,0.03,0.3,0,1.38,3.16,12.6,6.96,0.76,15.4,4.45,2.08,5.42,0.19,7.58,7.18,3.61,3.99,0.65,1,2.59,14.05,0.13,13.89,4.45,4.75,0.65,1.67,0.19,3.29,0.03,2.05,1.43,0.62,0.24,0.08,0.16,0.05,0.05,0,0,11.92,3.43,0.97,0.16,0.3,0.49,0.84,6.96,0,0.03,2.16,0.43,1.03,0.4,0.32,0.3,3.64,0.11,0.03,3.32,0.16,0.16,1.59,0.32,0.05,0.13,0.05,0,0.59,0,0.03,0.13,0,0.19,0.03,0.24,0,0.13,0.19,0.67,1.27,8.04,0.46,0.76,5.48,1.35,0.08,0.11,1.67,3.4,1.51,0.81,0.22,0.19,0.03,0,0,4.56,3.18,0,0,0,1.16,0.22,0,-0.647729758178911,-0.0204613191095832,-0.466824005303845,-1.13501508259234,25.52,-0.619269658571649,1.6017557874604,-1.04443208133584,-0.0358057256114239,-1.90875573515933,1.88261550832367,6.235

The crucial importance of the CD40L- CD40 system for many immune responses has been extensively described. This review focuses on the multiple roles that this system may play in HIV infection. In early HIV infection, CD40L expression contributes to the immunological control of viral replication by inducing HIV-sup- pressive chemokines and supporting the produc- tion of anti-HIV antibodies and cytotoxic T cells. However, by activating antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, CD40L can also lead to increased CD4ð T cell activa- tion, which promotes the replication of HIV in these lymphocytes. Later, with the development of AIDS, CD40L-expressing CD4ð T cells be- come selectively depleted, perhaps as a result of a gp120-induced signal through CD4 that down- regulates CD40L expression. This acquired CD40L deÞciency may explain the similarity be- tween the types of opportunistic infections that occur in AIDS and in congenital CD40L deÞ- ciency. Vaccines or other strategies that promote the growth of CD4ð T cells capable of expressing CD40L may help to sustain host immunity against HIV and prevent AIDS-deÞning opportunistic infections.",37.34,4332,1.75,8.22,5.787,1.982,0.07,3.72,2.225,0.739,0.57,3.72,2.423,0.582,0.07,2.75,1.705,0.88,0.717,1.19,5.57,3.246,1.16,1.52,5.57,3.102,1.125,1.19,4.97,3.625,1.219,-0.523,19,29,8,11,27,40,18,1,NA,3.07,8.28,6.136,1.308,95,148,1,4338,95.48,25.75,7.46,29.9,25.37,31.58,61.34,45.44,38.96,4.08,0.35,0.14,0.02,0,0,0.18,3.73,11.41,6.78,0.3,15.91,4.86,2.44,5.07,0.41,7.17,4.24,2.05,2.17,0.25,0.88,1.24,11.55,0.12,11.43,1.57,4.91,0.69,1.34,0.18,2.97,0.12,1.45,1.06,0.35,0.12,0.02,0.05,0,0,0,0,3.25,2.31,0.37,0.02,0.09,0.07,0.83,0.85,0,0,0.02,0.02,0.16,0,0.02,0.14,1.94,0.09,0.05,1.66,0.14,0.02,4.17,3.83,2.79,0.02,0,0.05,1.34,0.02,0.07,0.81,0.02,0.09,0.21,0.21,0,0.12,0.37,0.14,0.99,5.21,0.28,0.28,4.29,0.41,0,0.02,1.61,2.42,3.04,0.48,0.23,0.21,0.02,0,0,4.5,3.9,0,0.02,0,0.21,0.37,0,-0.729574360680139,0.282609308493758,-1.65074418723829,-2.09770923942467,38.66,-1.1445201957265,1.73286101643053,0.713497619232218,-0.305883198794736,0.22319306497596,1.38452857375503,6.136

The intranasal route offers an alternative for central nervous system delivery. Cubosomes have been reported as helpful vehicles for intranasal delivery of therapeutics to enable brain targeting. Objective: In this study, we aimed to develop the intranasal cubosomal thermogelling dispersion of saquinavir mesylate for central nervous system delivery. Methods: The BoxÐBehnken design was applied to study the effect of monoolein, Poloxamer 407, and polyvinyl alcohol as independent factors and the particle size, entrapment efÞciency, gelation temperature, and stability index as responses. The optimized cubosomes were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy, ex vivo permeation, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. Results: The optimized formula consisting of monoolein (8.96%), Poloxamer 407 (17.45%), and polyvinyl alcohol (7.5%) was prepared and evaluated. Higher values for the steady-state ßux, permeability coefÞcient, and enhancement factor were observed for the cubosomal thermogelling dispersion of saquinavir during ex vivo permeation in comparison with an aqueous suspension of saquinavir. From the pharmacokinetic proÞle, the relative bioavail- ability for the intranasal optimized formula was approximately 12-fold higher when com- pared with oral aqueous suspension and 2.5-fold greater when compared to the intranasal aqueous suspension of saquinavir.

According to results, the greatest dimensional characteristics were found for Page cultivar, whereas Onsho cultivar showed the lowest sphericity value (93%), and the highest sphericity was observed in Clementine cultivar (97%). The specific gravity of Page cultivar was 0/97, and this cultivar had the biggest fruit. Thus, it may be used for export.

The quality of groundwater has been taken for granted and the status and the potential threats to groundwater quality have not been investigated on a large scale in Zimbabwe. A borehole and shallow well water quality survey was undertaken between January, 2009 and February, 2010 to determine the chemical and microbial aspects of drinking water in three catchment areas. Groundwater quality physico-chemical indicators used in this study were nitrates, chloride, water hardness, conductiv- ity, alkalinity, total dissolved solids, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, calcium, ßuoride, sul- phates, sodium and pH. The microbiological indicators were total coliforms, faecal coliforms and heterotrophs. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that most of the variation in ground water quality in all catchment areas is accounted for by Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), sodium, bicarbonate and magnesium. The principal dissolved constituents in ground water are in the form of electrically charged ions. Nitrate is a signiÞcant problem as the World Health Organization recommended levels were exceeded in 36%, 37% and 22% of the boreholes in the Manyame, Mazowe and Gwayi catchment areas respectively. The nitrate levels were particularly high in commercial farming areas. Iron and manganese also exceeded the recommended levels. The probable source of high iron lev- els is the underlying geology of the area which is dominated by dolerites. Dolerites weather to give soils rich in iron and other maÞc minerals. The high level of manganese is probably due to the lithology of the rock as well as mining activity in some areas. Water hardness is a problem in all catchment areas, par- ticularly in the Gwayi catchment area where a value of 2550 mg/l was recorded in one borehole. The problems with hard water use are discussed. Chloride levels exceeded the recommended levels in a few areas under irrigation. Most of the chloride is probably from agricultural activity particularly the application of potassium chloride. Fluoride levels were particularly elevated in the Gwayi catchment area and this is because of the geology of the area. There was no evidence of microbial contamination in all the boreholes sampled as the total coliform, faecal coliforms, heterotrophs count was nil. However, severe microbial contamination was found in the wells especially those in clay areas.",45.46,2624,0.93,8.27,4.722,2.466,0.18,3.77,2.259,0.946,0.47,3.77,2.481,0.92,0.18,3.57,2.037,0.942,0.444,1.19,8.03,3.263,1.675,1.66,8.03,3.374,2.141,1.19,6.3,3.153,1.076,0.222,5,19,9,19,14,38,0,1,NA,1.97,8.17,6.153,1.286,58,98,1,2625,95.52,28.53,17.06,31.2,17.27,30.06,61.6,50.7,41.41,2.7,0.38,0,0,0.04,0,0.15,2.32,12.46,8.53,0.8,14.7,6.36,2.36,5.22,0.72,8.99,5.49,5.07,0.88,0.04,0.19,0.72,9.45,0.69,8.72,1.79,2.51,0.42,1.3,0.08,2.25,0,1.41,1.1,0.3,0.23,0.19,0.04,0,0,0,0,1.79,0.84,0.23,0,0,0.04,0.11,0.84,0,0,0.04,0,0.95,0.23,0,0.72,1.94,0.08,0.04,1.71,0.53,0,0.65,0.38,0.19,0.04,0,0,0,0.15,0.08,0.23,0,0.27,0.04,0.15,0,0,0.27,0.11,2.17,9.37,0.69,0.46,7.66,0.34,0,0.34,1.14,5.07,2.32,0.3,0.15,0.08,0,0.08,0,5.98,5.75,0,0,0,0.15,0.08,0,0.0661370525262445,-0.436440611898484,0.641203857275833,0.270900297903593,38.4,0.147804498427067,-0.233717418121475,0.678713622112911,0.459336308557981,0.965535443067664,-0.832071049207142,6.153

Moreover, for the inductive energy harvestersÕ wound coil and core, the parametric analysis is also performed. A Teflon housing is incorporated to protect the energy harvester prototypes from the harsh environmental conditions.

Binding of Þbrinogen to glycoprotein IIb-IIIa is biphasic, forming an initial reversible complex (KD = 155Ð180 nmol/L) and a second more stable complex (KD = 20Ð70 nmol/L). To test whether a comparable extent of inhibition would be maintained by pharmacologic antagonists that exhibit a rapid rate of release, blood from 26 patients with symptom- atic coronary artery disease was added to reaction tubes containing a concentration of either agent that had been shown to achieve optimal inhibition (for tiroÞban 100 ng/mL, for eptiÞbatide 1.7 mg/mL) plus a platelet agonist (1 mM adenosine diphosphate [ADP] or 25 mM thrombin receptor agonist peptide [TRAP]), and ßuorochrome labeled Þbrinogen before analysis by ßow cytometry. The extent of inhibition early on (30 seconds to 3 minutes) was similar.

The orientation of these alignments can be estimated through analyses of S-wave splitting. If sensors in ocean-bottom observations are deployed through free fall, sensor orientation needs to be determined in order for the recorded data to be used for such analyses. Here, we estimate the sensor orientation from the linear particle motions of P-to-s (Ps) phases converted at the sedimentÐbasement interface and also from T waves that are excited by earthquakes and propagate in the seawater. We ex- amine waveforms of local earthquakes recorded by 32 ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) that were deployed through free fall for three months in 2010 off Vancouver Island where the strike-slip Nootka fault zone (NFZ) intersects the deformation front of the Cascadia subduction zone. Because the particle motion of the Ps wave was corrected by estimating splitting parameters, the fast polarization direction, which reflects S-wave anisotropic structure within the sediment, can also be evaluated. Con- sequently, we could estimate the fast polarization direction at OBSs deployed near the NFZ and west of the deformation front. The obtained fast directions appeared to cor- respond to alignments of shear fractures in the marine sediments associated with the left-lateral motion of the fault in the basement along the NFZ, margin-normal cracks due to horizontal compression west of and slightly away from the deformation front, and frontal thrust faults within the accretionary prism near the deformation front.",44.17,6299,1.24,7.1,4.064,1.871,0.18,3.26,1.73,0.774,0.47,2.6,1.94,0.677,0.18,3.26,1.624,0.817,0.316,1.19,6.15,2.915,1.431,2.03,6.15,3.446,1.491,1.19,6.06,2.65,1.365,0.796,8,9,8,18,16,27,-9,1,NA,1.1,8.17,5.801,1.431,107,222,1,6341,98.38,37.08,67.64,20.05,27.1,27.05,66.33,51.77,43.02,3.47,1.42,0.02,1.31,0,0,0.09,2.05,15.58,12.06,0.82,15.28,4.24,1.85,5.66,0.24,6.51,4.65,4.29,1.77,1.37,0.13,0.27,10.17,0.19,9.97,2.08,2.11,0.74,1.77,0.09,3.19,0,0.65,0.32,0.33,0.17,0.11,0.06,0.06,0,0,0,2.29,0.66,0.05,0.02,0,0,0.47,1.61,0.05,0,0.05,0.03,0.17,0.02,0.03,0.13,1.06,0,0.27,0.62,0.13,0.06,0.16,0.13,0,0.02,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,0.21,0.08,0.08,0,0,0.03,0.14,1.64,15.58,0.65,3.55,10.58,0.96,0.17,0.05,1.97,1.5,2.73,0.46,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,3.67,3.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.67120064602255,-0.0917720550162523,0.0492437663086077,1.62867235731491,33.67,0.888611429141454,-0.561480490546809,0.0459124437501343,0.099233010980232,0.847601740144228,-0.573791368779681,5.801

There is substantial evidence that nucleolar dominance is regulated developmentally. This study focuses upon the establishment and/or maintenance of nucleolar dominance during different stages of development in the model grass allotetraploid Brachypodium hybridum. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a 25S rDNA probe to cells in three-dimensional cytogenetic preparations showed that nucleolar dominance is present not only in root meristematic and differentiated cells of this species, but also in male meiocytes at prophase I, tetrads of microspores, and different embryonic tissues. The inactive state of Brachypodium stacei- originated rDNA loci was confirmed by silver staining. Only B.Êdistachyon-derived 35S rDNA loci formed nucleoli in the aforementioned tissues, whereas B.Êstacei-like loci remained highly condensed and thus transcriptionally sup- pressed.

However, not all tumor-inÞltrating T cells confer beneÞt to patients. Therefore, it is of substantial beneÞt to identify a bio- marker to demarcate these tumor-reactive lymphocytes. Methods: We investigated whether ITGAE could be used to discriminate reactive CD8+ lymphocytes in colorectal cancer (CRC). TCGA colorectal cancer data sets (n1 = 492, n2 = 386) and FUSCC set (n3 = 276) were used in this study. Further phenotyping of ITGAE+ cells and the mechanistic basis were investigated. Findings: In the training and testing sets from TCGA, ITGAE expression, which is strongly correlated with cytotoxic T cell markers (CD8/CD3/PD1), independently predicted longer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). In line with this, the association between ITGAE+ lymphocytes and survival has been conÞrmed in the FUSCC cohort for validation (P = .026). ITGAE + cells in the series always co-stained with CD8 were preferential- ly located in the tumor. Interestingly, ITGAE+ lymphocytes tended to associate with the epithelialÐmesenchymal transition (EMT) with decreased Snail and increased E-cadherin expression accompanied. Finally, gene set en- richment analysis showed that immune activation was signiÞcantly enriched in the high ITGAE+ TIL group, ac- companied by enriched EMT-related pathways. Interpretation: Because of the speciÞed expression of tumor-reactive CD8+ T-cells, ITGAE may be a promising biomarker for the rapid identiÞcation of immune inÞltration in CRC.",32.43,3360,1.24,8.22,6.107,1.939,1.79,3.72,2.459,0.453,2.06,3.72,2.478,0.45,1.79,3.26,2.373,0.496,0.105,1.8,6.06,3.09,0.879,2.03,4.44,2.985,0.686,1.8,6.06,3.567,1.463,-0.582,11,32,6,7,17,39,25,1,NA,1.1,8.54,6.313,1.378,69,117,1,3365,93.97,41.99,18.57,24.4,21.85,34.74,64.75,46.81,38.19,3.42,1.01,0.09,0.77,0.03,0,0.09,2.41,10.31,6.86,0.33,14.86,5.41,2.17,6.48,0.33,7.9,4.93,3.48,2.35,1.37,0.53,0.45,9.57,0.39,9.18,2.64,2.23,0.33,1.16,0.18,2.5,0.09,1.63,0.98,0.65,0.06,0.03,0.03,0,0,0,0,4.01,1.58,0.21,0.18,0.06,0,0.77,2.44,0.03,0,0.03,0,0.36,0,0,0.36,2.23,0.12,0.06,1.72,0.15,0.3,7.25,6.86,2.88,0.03,0,0,0.03,0.03,0.06,0.21,0,0.36,0.03,0.06,0.03,0.12,0.12,0.33,1.84,7.37,0.36,0.3,5.88,0.98,0,0.03,2.11,6,0.95,0.53,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,4.67,4.55,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,-0.693198981790704,-0.341359630689592,-0.565484020465049,-1.60004263294534,35.25,-0.872990914570983,-0.463151568819209,0.257292118552077,-0.260870286597517,-0.225686377934172,-0.592293700306426,6.313

Application of 5-HT (1.0-100/~M) to the Ringer's solution significantly reduced afferent terminal depolarizations elicited by concentrations of GABA ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mM. The reductions of GABA-depolarizations which were produced by 1.0 ktM 5-HT were mimicked by the 5-HTa, ~ agonists 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(n-dipropylamino)tetralin) and ipsapirone. The effects of ipsapirone were reversed by the 5-HTaA antagonist spiperone. The decreases of GABA-depolarizations produced by high doses of 5-HT were duplicated by application of a-methyl-5-HT, a 5-HTlc/2 agonist and reversed by superfusion of the cord with mianserin, a 5-HTlc/2 antagonist. The presumptive 5-HTa,x receptor-mediated effects of 1.0/~M 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT appeared to result from a direct action on afferent terminals because the reduction of GABA responses was unchanged by addition of TTX to the Ringer's solution. In contrast, the putative 5-HT~¢/z receptor actions of 100 #M 5-HT and a-methyl-5-HT were substantially reduced by TI'X and are presumably caused by activation of receptors located on interneurons. GABA B receptors did not appear to be affected by addition of 5-HT at low or high concentrations because baclofen-induced afferent terminal hyperpolarizations remained unchanged during exposure to 5-HT. The effects of 5-HT on GABA- depolarizations were not caused by changes in GABA uptake or changes in the rate of desensitization of GABA receptors because: (1) afferent terminal depolarizations produced by the non-transportable GABA,~ receptor agonist muscimol were significantly reduced by 8-OH-DPAT and (2) the decrement in depolarization produced by repetitive exposure to GABA, which is caused by both 'receptor' desensitization and by neuronal transport of GABA, was unaffected by 5-HT. These observations are important in understanding the action of 5-HT on transmission of sensory information by afferent fibers.",21.77,2034,1,7.57,4.803,2.561,1.6,3.5,2.395,0.762,1.6,3.07,2.023,0.45,1.66,3.5,3.138,0.73,-1.115,1.41,7.92,4.443,2.017,1.41,4.93,3.617,1.282,2.44,7.92,6.095,2.304,-2.478,8,12,4,6,12,18,6,1,NA,1.7,8.24,6.173,1.399,56,81,1,2034,97.78,24.55,27.04,9.74,32.81,36.04,65.29,48.72,40.12,3.29,0.54,0.2,0.29,0,0,0.05,2.75,11.41,8.26,0.15,17.06,5.06,1.92,4.57,0.44,7.87,4.72,2.46,1.92,0.39,0.84,0.69,13.67,0.1,13.57,3.54,5.56,0.29,1.33,0.15,3,0,1.72,0.29,1.38,1.33,0.05,1.23,0,0.29,0.54,0,2.7,2.16,0.15,0.44,0.29,0.05,0.98,0.44,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0.25,3.24,0.15,0,2.9,0.15,0.05,1.97,0.74,0,0.05,0.39,0.15,0,0,0.05,0.1,0.05,0.2,0.05,0.25,0,0,0.05,0.1,1.72,7.33,0.74,0.64,5.56,0.39,0,0.1,2.11,4.33,2.02,0.64,0.44,0.15,0,0.29,0,3.05,3.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.0566298512255974,0.966003860932664,-1.33958567788373,-0.43021166817666,34.71,-0.234725544137098,2.2654760091217,0.185048432227361,-0.17084446220308,-1.20023930286737,3.58688266228241,6.173

Furthermore, Experiment 2 tests an educational epilogue designed to reinforce the disapproval message, but this message instead induces boomerang effects among smokers.

However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of GA on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13-acetate (TPA)-mediated skin inflammation has not been elucidated. Herein, we investigated the anti- inflammatory activity of GA by using a TPA-induced mouse ear model. It was indicated that GA, applied topically onto mouse ears, effectively inhibited the TPA-mediated expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in a dose-dependent manner, respectively. Mechanistic in- vestigations demonstrated that GA down-regulated the expressions of I_B_ and p65 and blocked the phosphorylation of I_B_ and p65 in TPA-induced mouse skin. Moreover, GA significantly inhibited the TPA- mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, which are upstream of nuclear factor-kB (NF-_B). Taken together, these results indicated that GA, being of natural origin, may be a potential agent for preventing inflammatory diseases.",33.68,3008,1.24,7.48,4.839,1.737,0.07,3.26,1.337,1.14,0.47,2.98,1.886,0.783,0.07,3.26,0.897,1.205,0.988,1.19,6.06,2.631,1.262,1.41,3.72,2.366,0.74,1.19,6.06,2.843,1.548,-0.478,11,16,6,20,17,36,-4,1,NA,2,8.54,6.626,1.085,47,96,1,3008,97.67,39.48,13.47,22.73,28.11,32.95,65.19,47.91,38.36,2.79,0.6,0.07,0.43,0,0.07,0.03,2.19,11.34,7.98,0.83,16.09,4.32,1.96,5.12,0.1,6.42,4.45,4.62,2.19,0.53,0.6,1.1,10.41,0.27,10.11,2.96,5.09,0.17,0.4,0.07,1.99,0,1.06,0.53,0.33,0.07,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,2.83,1.03,0.17,0.03,0,0.03,0.37,1.76,0.07,0,0.2,0.1,0.43,0.03,0,0.4,2.79,0.07,0.07,2.36,0.17,0.2,5.32,2.93,1.86,0.13,0,0,0,0.03,0.07,0.13,0,0.3,0.1,0.07,0,0.03,0.23,0.27,0.6,8.21,0.63,0.07,5.22,0.76,1.6,0.03,1.96,4.49,1.03,0.23,1.23,0.37,0,0.86,0,3.52,3.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.183943677338618,0.389575412353761,0.299688420179357,0.505320155194499,34.81,0.275705093946372,1.88035439902193,0.198426892657865,-0.395909023189173,-0.111409534016114,2.86180494283146,6.626

The analysis documents that from 1976 to 2001 powerful organizations and individuals employed active strat- egies of avoidance, deÞance, and manipulation to successfully defeat proposals that would have required all public com- panies to assess and publicly report on their internal controls over Þnancial reporting. During this same period, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) vacillated between actively advocating mandatory internal control report- ing and passively acquiescing to industry and White House demands for voluntary internal control reporting. The resulting dramaturgical exchange between the SEC and its regulatees made it appear as if the voluntary initiatives were reasonably e_ective, but subsequent accounting and Þnancial scandals challenged this view and eventually precipitated mandatory internal control assessment and reporting. The paper also considers how the ongoing dramaturgical exchange between regulators and regulatees could signiÞcantly weaken the internal control requirements of SOX (2002) [SarbanesÐOxley Act of 2002 (2002).

Docetaxel is relatively less hydrophobic and twice as potent as paclitaxel. Like other taxane chemother- apeutic agents, docetaxel is not well tolerated and shows toxicity in the patients. Nanoencapsulation of potent chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to improve tolerabil- ity and therapeutic outcome. Therefore, the present study was designed to fabricate chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) based on ionically cross-linked nanoparticles for sustained release of docetaxel. Methods: Nanoparticles were prepared by the ionic-gelation method by dropwise addition of the STPP solution into the chitosan solution in different ratios. CNPs were characterized for post-formulation parameters like size, zeta potential, scanning electron microscope (SEM), FTIR, DSC/TGA, pXRD, and in-vitro drug release, as well as for acute oral toxicity studies in Wistar rats. Results and discussion: The optimized docetaxel loaded polymeric nanoparticles were in the size range (172.6nmÐ479.65 nm), and zeta potential (30.45Ð35.95 mV) required to achieve enhanced permeation and retention effect. In addition, scanning electron microscopy revealed rough and porous surface, whereas, FTIR revealed the compatible polymeric nanoparticles. Likewise, the thermal stability was ensured through DSC and TG analysis, and powder X-ray diffraction analysis exhibited solid-state stability of the docetaxel loaded nanoparticles. The in-vitro drug release evaluation in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) showed sustained release pattern, i.e. 51.57Ð69.93% within 24 hrs. The data were Þtted to different release kinetic models which showed Fickian diffusion as a predominant release mechanism (R2= 0.9734Ð0.9786, n= 0.264Ð0.340). Acceptable tolerability was exhibited by acute oral toxicity in rabbits and no abnormality was noted in growth, behavior, blood biochemistry or histology and function of vital organs. Conclusion: Ionically cross-linked chitosan nanoparticles are non-toxic and biocompatible drug delivery systems for sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents, such as docetaxel.",30.43,3498,1.67,8.45,5.612,2.181,0.18,3.95,2.27,0.822,1.6,3.95,2.486,0.719,0.18,2.83,1.81,0.881,0.676,1.19,4.97,2.92,1.129,1.34,4.8,2.937,1.056,1.19,4.97,2.882,1.348,0.055,14,17,7,8,21,25,9,1,NA,3.68,8.28,6.341,1.043,63,111,1,3496,98.09,31.27,13.27,26.6,32.37,33.18,66.56,50.97,39.16,2.06,0.29,0.06,0.03,0,0,0.17,1.77,10.84,8.58,0.26,16.73,5.18,1.54,5.52,0.17,8.44,4.83,5.12,1.49,0.14,0.8,0.66,8.55,0.31,8.24,2.37,2.06,0.29,1,0.06,2.17,0,1.17,0.8,0.31,0.17,0.09,0.03,0.03,0,0,0,1.57,0.72,0.17,0.06,0.03,0.06,0.26,0.8,0.03,0,0.03,0.03,0.31,0.09,0.06,0.17,2.52,0,0.03,2.26,0.14,0.11,4.2,3,0.63,0.26,0.03,0,0.03,0.03,0.14,0.14,0.06,1.03,0.11,0.03,0,0.11,0.29,0.2,0.86,7.55,0.63,0.49,5.15,1.37,0,0.14,2.03,6.04,1.66,0.72,0.26,0.23,0,0.03,0,3.2,3.09,0,0,0,0.06,0.06,0,0.0888716643321415,0.769899337189326,0.679150016953219,1.53792101847469,33.44,0.839097064548039,-0.602450874599976,0.0151419847599776,0.00920718658579472,-0.408529328203065,0.65111031632531,6.341

Cultivated Brassica germplasm has failed so far to provide any source of resistance. Wild germplasm is a potential source of resistance against many threatening herbivores. On wild germplasm screening, we noted that the wild crucifer Rorippa indica (L.) Hiern confers resistance against L. erysimi. In the present study L. erysimi challenged transcriptome of R. indica was compared to un-infested R. indica sample to get a molecular insight about the aphid resistance mechanism and identify the candidate defense response genes. Cloning, sequencing and in silico sequence analysis of complimentary DNA amplified fragment length polymorphism identified 116 differentially expressed transcript derived fragments revealed thirty candidates which are from different functional categories including redox regulation, signalling, photosynthesis, structure, metabolism, defense response as well as a few of unknown function. Twenty four identifications were then studied by quantitative real time RT PCR analysis at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hour time point post infestation to understand the early-to-late defense response through their relative gene expression profiles. Seventeen fragments showed significant up or down regulation at p,0.05 level. The response was influenced by different phytohormonal signalling pathways simultaneously. The candidate defense response expressed sequence tags specifically for the resistance genes identified in this study have implication in building desired mustard aphid resistance in susceptible rapeseed-mustard plants in future.

A comparison of LC50 values for metals for this species with those for other freshwater gastropods reveals that M. tuberculata is equally sensitive to metals.",38.45,3239,0.59,8.45,4.14,2.487,0.18,3.95,2.273,1.01,0.54,3.95,2.072,0.785,0.18,3.91,2.445,1.16,-0.374,1.19,6.06,3.435,1.646,1.41,5.83,2.794,1.363,1.19,6.06,3.984,1.697,-1.19,13,18,10,21,23,39,-3,1,NA,3.07,8.38,6.226,1.098,70,140,1,3247,94.46,27.61,17.48,19.87,24.23,28.18,63.47,51.31,41.79,3.23,0.46,0,0,0,0,0.37,2.77,12.29,7.45,0.71,15.4,6.22,1.76,6.9,0.25,9.12,5.51,5.05,1.48,0.18,0.74,0.59,9.61,0.28,9.27,2.59,2,0.59,1.05,0,2.86,0,0.77,0.37,0.4,0.09,0.06,0.03,0.03,0,0,0,1.29,0.4,0,0.03,0.03,0.03,0.09,0.83,0.06,0,0.12,0.06,0.06,0,0,0.06,2.43,0,0.06,2.25,0.06,0.06,2.13,1.08,0.03,0.06,0,0,0,0.22,0.31,0.18,0,0.92,0.03,0.03,0,0.65,0.22,0.09,1.36,8.22,0.68,0.22,5.76,0.99,0,0.65,2.13,4.74,2.03,0.59,0.06,0,0,0.06,0,4.16,4.1,0,0,0,0.06,0,0,-0.424930562481123,-0.0204613191095832,0.626025393404878,0.180633511814171,36.53,0.0985545081324144,-0.651615335463776,0.428536412062511,-0.125831550005861,0.324670902375195,-0.323363767638185,6.226
